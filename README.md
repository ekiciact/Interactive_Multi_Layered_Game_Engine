Core functionality of the game is implemented:
- Game and text view,
- Save and load game,
- Auto play,


To do tasks:
- Restart and new game (UI and signal is implemented but the game crashes when it is clicked)
- New level (Portal is crated on the views and added randomly on an empty tile, creation of the new level is also implemented but when 
   Protagonist enter the portal the game is crashing)
- Animations (poison effect, protagonis death, portal entry etc.) should be improved, now basic QT animatios are being used.
- Panel should be improved with more visuals on game view such as bar, graffic etc.
- Auto play mode some down sizes (more efficient way of achieving the goal, calculating the poison effect of the enemy as well,        avoiding portal before map ends etc.). These need to be fixed
